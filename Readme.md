Web Scraping project using Scrap and python. 

IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is one of the most frequented movie rating sites, and for many people, these rating dictate whether or not a movie is even worth watching. 
The rating system isn't based on hand selected critics, it revolves around its users (which is open to anyone). These anonymous users hold great power in what movies are deemed must watch, or don't even bother. 
So the question is, WHO are the individuals behind these reviews? With this question in mind, I decided to scrape IMDb's demographic rating breakdown to look a little more closely into who's behind the scene.
